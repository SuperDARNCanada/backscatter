# backscatter
A Python2.7 package of analysis tools for SuperDARN data

Documentation, installation, and usage can be found at:
http://backscatter.readthedocs.io/

There is a seperate branch called rtd. This branch has a modified version of the install to comply with the readthedocs platform. It removes the hardware file dependence and any dependence to numpy. It won't run correctly, but its enough so that readthedocs can import it and parse docstrings. If you add code, make sure you merge your files to this branch so that it autodocuments it for you.
